# em-modeler
Model of the Elephant Money Protocol on BSC

## Usage
- Run EM-Money.py to generate the output files and plots
- All model parameters are currently hard-coded and must be changed in EM-Money.py

## Notes
- To run the queries on the blockchain, you must install the Moralis module and sign up for an API.  Add that variable into a file called "api.py"
- Otherwise the token and LP data is stored in the pickle file and that can be used for repeated runs
